[10/8/15, 5:57:13 PM] darryl: ok, so lets say 2 people, 175 hours per month, six months.  that includes 1) project management; 2) design and implementation, 3) hired gun.  how does that translate between you and me?
[10/8/15, 5:58:02 PM] Aaron Downey: How about we split the profit and you make your agreed hourly rate for the work you put in.
[10/8/15, 6:01:21 PM] darryl: ok.  now what is my hourly rate?  135/hr? does that give us enough room?
[10/8/15, 6:03:50 PM] Aaron Downey: I think that is fair.  That will give Dann enough room for his 10% and provide some margin.  You will be in on the negotiation so we may have to move stuff around when we get closer to closing
[10/8/15, 6:04:11 PM] darryl: sounds good
